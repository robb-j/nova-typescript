# nova-typescript

[apexskier/nova-typescript](https://github.com/apexskier/nova-typescript) is no longer in active maintenance, I thought I'd see how hard it would be to make my own version of it.

This doesn't have all the features, but it does have the ones I think I'd use to work with TypeScript in Nova.
I tried to simplify it to a "core" and modernise bits that were using older APIs or where APIs have become available.
There is no guarantee I'll work on this any more, publish or support it.
